1. Select needed IMU board, set DEBUG_IMU and DEBUG_IMU_RAW_DATA to 1, recompile and upload the FW.

2. Open "Serial Monitor" in Arduino IDE

3. Rotate the device manually in various directions to accumulate all IMU spatial positions as many as possible.
   The more random data you'll get the better.

4. Copy all the Serial Monitor output into serial_out.log file.

5. Extract raw magnetometer data (X, Y, Z) from serial_out.log to .csv file:
cat ./serial_out.log | grep -E "^Raw" | awk '{print $8","$9","$10}' >./mag_raw.csv

6. Plot the data and check out how it looks
./plot_raw.m

7. Find and remove all odd "dots" dropped out of the "sphere" surface if any:
cat ./mag_raw.csv | sort -t "," -k 1 -g | less
cat ./mag_raw.csv | sort -t "," -k 2 -g | less
cat ./mag_raw.csv | sort -t "," -k 3 -g | less

8. Copy hard iron offsets into code (an appropriate 'imu_*.ino' file):
cat ./mag_raw.cvs | ./cal_hard_iron.py >./mag_hard.csv

9. Copy soft iron offsets into code (same 'imu_*.ino' file):
cat ./mag_hard.csv | ./cal_soft_iron.py >./mag_soft.csv
